### [Conventional Commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)

- This is the pattern being used to write commit messages in the project
- The pattern is composed by two parts, 'type' and 'description', as follows: `<type>: <description>`
- List of types:
  - 🛠 build -> Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)
  - ♻️ chore -> Other changes that don't modify src or test files
  - ⚙️ ci -> Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Travis, Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs)
  - 📚 docs -> Documentation only changes
  - ✨ feat -> A new feature
  - 🐛 fix -> A bug Fix
  - 🚀 perf -> A code change that improves performance
  - 📦 refactor -> A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
  - 🗑 revert -> Reverts a previous commit
  - 💎 style -> Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
  - 🚨 tests -> Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- Examples:
  - "feat: adds new dashboard component"
  - "fix: solves sidebar not closing bug"
  - "style: applies prettier formatting on main.js file"
